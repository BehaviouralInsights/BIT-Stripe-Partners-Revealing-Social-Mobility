**Revealing Social Mobility: Income mobility across England**

Our Revealing Social Capital project funded by the Nuffield Foundation, explores how social connections influence people's life outcomes, with a focus on social mobility. As part of our ongoing research, we're publishing, in collaboration with Stripe Partners, a series of regional social mobility statistics for England. Later this year, we plan to publish more detailed social mobility estimates, covering smaller geographical areas and using different approaches.    

We use Longitudinal Education Outcomes (LEO) data which links individuals’ school records with their adult earnings data to construct a simple measure of social mobility (based on van der Erve et al. (2024)). As a proxy for parents' income during a person’s childhood, we use whether someone was eligible for Free School Meals (FSM) at age 16. FSM eligibility is a widely used indicator of economic disadvantage, as it typically signifies parents in the lowest income groups. Data on FSM eligibility at age 16 for the 1986-92 birth cohorts allows us to identify the ~14% of individuals from the lowest-income families. We then observe their earnings rank at age 28, using a higher rank as an indicator of greater upward social mobility relative to their disadvantaged starting point.
